APS (algorithmic problem solving)
first class with ph sir
we started with probability . first question was

    "there is bag with two hats in it red and blue. everytime when you pick red  hat ,you add another red hat to bag . everytime when you pick blue hat,
you add another blue hat to the bag run these iteration 100 times for every iteration print the hat selected the total number of hats in the bag and
probability of selecting red and blue hat"

if we pick red then we add blue to bag
if we pick blue then add red to it

printing the probabilties of picking red and blue for iteration

in this we get probabilty of 7:3 (70% 30%)

here the main reason is reinforcement
in probablity we have another rule that is 
"Polya's urn model"
where past or previous selection effect on future probability
   Real-World Applications:
Financial markets → Popular stocks get more investment, increasing their dominance.
Social networks → Viral content gets more engagement, reinforcing its reach.
Machine learning → Reinforcement learning adapts based on past successes.




2nd question is 

# prompt: there is bag with two hats in it red and blue. everytime when you pick red  hat you will add  blue hat to bag .  when you pick blue hat you  will add  red hat to the bag
# run these iteration 100 times for every iteration print the hat selected the total number of hats in the bag and probability of selecting red and blue hat



it get 50:50

because we were adding opposite color when we pick something 
it always try to be at equilibrium
